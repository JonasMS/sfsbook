# stop-violence

## About the project
We are building an interactive resource guide based on the [PDF referral guide](http://sfwar.org/pdf/RefGuide.pdf) compiled by SFWAR. The guide will allow volunteers to help maintain the guide to make sure that it is a publicly available source of up-to-date information about the resources available to survivors in the SF Bay Area.

This is the respository for the project that came out of the Code Across 2016. Currently we're in the exploratory phase of the project. 

## How to contribute
We are currently in the process of defining the scope of the project. Some pieces are ready to be designed and built, other still need to be figured out. 

If you want to help with feature definition, [Check out the issues page](https://github.com/sfbrigade/stop-violence/issues) and join the discussion.

If you want to help us design or built fully defined features, [head over to the issues page](https://github.com/sfbrigade/stop-violence/issues) grab an unassigned issue and jump right in! 

### Research and Notes
We're using the wiki to share our research findings, notes on the project, and design artifacts. 

If you want to get started on the research initives we're currently working on, first check out our [Research Guidelines](https://github.com/sfbrigade/stop-violence/wiki/Research-Guidelines). After reading through the guidelines, if you want to help us conduct research you can find interview and observation guides that will get you out into the field and collecting data in the [Research Tools section](https://github.com/sfbrigade/stop-violence/wiki/Research-Tools)
