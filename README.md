# stop-violence

## About the project
This is the respository for the project that came out of the Code Across 2016. Currently we're in the exploratory phase of the project. 

## How to contribute
Right now we are working on understanding the problem and the people and agencies in SF that work on the very wide range of problems that fall under the category "violence against women." 

### Issues
We're adding issues to the project as we identify tasks that need to be completed. [Check out the issues page](https://github.com/sfbrigade/stop-violence/issues) to see what we've currently identified.

### Research and Notes
We're using the wiki to share our research findings, notes on the project, and design artifacts. 

If you want to get started on the research initives we're currently working on, first check out our [Research Guidelines](https://github.com/sfbrigade/stop-violence/wiki/Research-Guidelines). After reading through the guidelines, if you want to help us conduct research you can find interview and observation guides that will get you out into the field and collecting data in the [Research Tools section](https://github.com/sfbrigade/stop-violence/wiki/Research-Tools)
