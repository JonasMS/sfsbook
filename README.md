# stop-violence

## About the project
This is the respository for the project that came out of the Code Across 2016. Currently we're in the exploratory phase of the project. 

## How to contribute
Right now we are working on understnading the problem and the people and agencies in SF that work on the very wide range of problems that fall under the category "violence against women." There are notes happening in the Wiki and to-dos posted in the issues. If you want to get in on the ground floor of this project and help us out, feel free to jump in.
